## Zodiac graphic system

Good code is modular, and so is good design. Both are best when they follow a defined system of constraints. 

Animated Zodiac symbols using only CSS and <div> elements. JavaScript helper functions allow a minimal set of elements (circle, triangle) to be reused for every zodiac symbol.  


This program aims to unite modular design principles with modular coding principles. Simpler and more modular icons lead to simpler and more modular code, and vice versa.

Practicing:
CSS animations
CSS variables
Clip paths
JavaScript methods
JavaScrip arrow functions
